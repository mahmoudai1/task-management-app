## Overview
- Laravel APIs, NextJs (Typescript) Front-end, and RethinkDB are used.
- Fixed issues inside the core of Laravel 11 files and RethinkDB Package, in order to different compatibility versions between Laravel 11 and RethinkDB.
- Users can add New Task `/api/add-new-task` to RethinkDB.
- Users can display their tasks `/api/tasks/{status}` from RethinkDB after either seeding to the database dummy tasks using command `php artisan db:seed --class=TaskSeeder` or Add New One from the Front End.
- A hardcoded data also exists but not used.

## Design
- Simple, modern, and light design.
- Followed UI/UX best practices with different media queries.
- TailwindCSS is used for styling.

## Project Structure
- App started at Page.tsx and it includes /components/TasksList.tsx.
- At first, TasksList.tsx fetches all the tasks by calling a Laravel GET API `/api/tasks/{status}`, and pass `status` with 'all'.
- If a task clicked, it will open up a /components/ViewTask.tsx Modal, in order to get the full description for this task.
- If the selectedTab for status is changed, a Laravel GET API `/api/tasks/{status}` is called with the selectedTab (status) name, then it return only the tasks for this status.
- Tasks can be added from AddNewTask.tsx form, after clicking on the (+) button, a Laravel POST API `/api/add-new-task` is then sent with formData, in order to insert into RethinkDB.
